# User Module

## Introduction

The user module services serves as a bridging module between the modules that
the user has taken and the user himself. Even though the modules may change 
over time, such as the professor teaching, the module code or description, we 
do not need to be updating these as it is meant to capture a snapshot at what 
is happening at that point in time.

For instance, supposed that the module CS2040C is being replaced with CS2040X, 
we do not need to rename the module name because as far as the student and 
others are concerned, the student took CS2040C and not CS2040X.

## Relevant APIs
### saveModule

```typescript
type saveModuleServiceRequest = ReadOnly<{
    moduleCode: string,
    semesterTaken: number
}>

```

#### Context
Supposed that the user wants to be able to indicate that he has taken the
module, he can do so via this single API. After doing so, he would be able to 
register his grades or give his or her feedback about the module itself.

#### Input Parameters

{
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Attributes</th>
                <th>Data Type</th>
                <th>Required</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>moduleCode</td>
                <td>String</td>
                <td>True</td>
                <td>The NUS module code (e.g. CS1010, CS2040C)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>semesterTaken</td>
                <td>int</td>
                <td>True</td>
                <td>The semester that the student took the module</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
}

#### Example Responses

The API will throw under the following conditions.

1. The user has already registered for the module. This might happen because 
the user is using the application on 2 different devices, which led to 
inconsistency. 

2. When the schema is incorrect

Upon success, the user will have added the module into his list.
