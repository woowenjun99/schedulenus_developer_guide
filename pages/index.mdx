# ScheduleNUS

## Introduction
ScheduleNUS is a mobile app built using Flutter and Firebase Cloud Functions. 
It's main goal is to become a companion application that can help students with
their academic plans.

## Directory Structure
This documentation serves as a guide for developers who wish to work on the 
project. It documents everything regarding the application, from the Frontend
to the Backend. The general directory structure is as follows:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.File name="Home" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="Frontend" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="Introduction" />
        <FileTree.File name="Setup" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="Backend" defaultOpen>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="miscellaneous" defaultOpen>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="services" defaultOpen>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
